# SpaceXTest

1)
 
I've worked with API's for many years.  Used API when developing IOS and Android Apps whilst at Mantic Point.  
I've also used Laravel to create APIs - specifically for using Vue.JS components.

2) 

I'm planning on looking at the SpaceX API calls using Postman.  I noticed that along with the 'Launches by Year' call there's one state states 'Next Launch'.  I plan to do a fetch of the next launch first to obtain the next launch - I could have done this programmatically but felt this would be a more elegant solution.  If the API is slow then I'd switch to programmatically working out the next date.

3)

I'd have liked to add BootStrap to the page (I realise this wasn't allowed) to make it more mobile friendly and add some accordian like dropdowns to display the mission details or expand on some of the other date.
